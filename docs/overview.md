# Sauce Bindings

### Making test automation with Sauce Labs intuitively simple

Writing and maintaining automated test frameworks is hard work. 
Sauce Labs wants to help make this work simpler. We've created Sauce Bindings, a collection of tools to make connecting to and working with Sauce Labs simple.

Sauce Bindings has three main goals:

-   Providing test developers with a wrapper or _binding_ for each programming language commonly used with web and mobile testing,
-   Providing a concise API for connecting to Sauce Labs in test frameworks and making use of Sauce Labs features,
-   Providing an excellent developer user experience for using Sauce Labs in a straightforward, intuitive way.

## Supported Language Bindings

We support the most popular automation programming languages:

-   [Java](https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce_bindings/tree/master/java),
-   [C#](https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce_bindings/tree/master/dotnet),
-   [Python](https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce_bindings/tree/master/python),
-   [Ruby](https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce_bindings/tree/master/ruby)

We're here for you if you [have questions](/help.html).
